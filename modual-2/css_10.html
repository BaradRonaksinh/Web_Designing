    <!-- Why should background and color be used as separate properties? -->

    While background and colour are often used together for elements, they serve different purposes. "Colour" sets the
    text colour, while "background" defines the background colour or image. Separating them allows for more flexibility
    in styling, as background properties can include images, gradients, and positioning.
