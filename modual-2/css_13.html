    <!-- What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page? -->

    CSS may be added to HTML in three different ways. To style a single HTML element on the page, use Inline CSS in a
    style attribute. By adding CSS to the head section of our HTML document, we can embed an internal stylesheet. We can
    also connect to an external stylesheet that separates our CSS from our HTML.
