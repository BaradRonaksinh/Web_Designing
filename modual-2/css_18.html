    <!-- What are the media types allowed by CSS? -->

    The @media rule, introduced in CSS2, made it possible to define different style rules for different media types.

    Media queries in CSS3 extended the CSS2 media types idea: Instead of looking for a type of device, they look at the
    capability of the device.

    Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:

    width and height of the viewport
    orientation of the viewport (landscape or portrait)
    resolution

    Using media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet to desktops, laptops, tablets, and
    mobile phones (such as iPhone and Android phones).
