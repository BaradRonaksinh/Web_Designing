    HTML character entities are used as a replacement of reserved characters in HTML.
     You can also replace characters that are not present on your keyboard by entities. <br>

    These characters are replaced because some characters are reserved in HTML.
    HTML entities provide a wide range of characters which can allow you to add icons,
    geometric shapes, mathematical operators, etc. <br><br><br>
